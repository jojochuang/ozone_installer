# OM Bootstrapping with Snapshots - Design Document

## Overview

This document describes the design and implementation details for OM (OzoneManager) bootstrapping functionality using snapshots. This feature enables efficient initialization and synchronization of OzoneManager instances in distributed Ozone clusters.

## Design Goals

- Provide fast OM initialization using snapshot-based bootstrapping
- Ensure data consistency across OM instances
- Minimize downtime during OM scaling operations
- Support reliable recovery mechanisms

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Snapshot Manager**: Handles creation and management of OM state snapshots
2. **Bootstrap Service**: Coordinates the bootstrapping process for new OM instances
3. **State Transfer Protocol**: Manages secure and reliable transfer of snapshot data
4. **Validation Engine**: Ensures integrity and consistency of transferred snapshots

### Data Flow

```
[Source OM] -> [Snapshot Creation] -> [Snapshot Transfer] -> [Target OM] -> [Validation] -> [Bootstrap Complete]
```

## Implementation Details

### Snapshot Creation Process

1. Create a consistent point-in-time snapshot of OM metadata
2. Generate checksums for integrity verification
3. Package snapshot data for efficient transfer
4. Store snapshot metadata for tracking and validation

### Bootstrap Sequence

1. **Initialization**: New OM instance requests bootstrap from cluster
2. **Snapshot Selection**: Identify the most recent consistent snapshot
3. **Data Transfer**: Securely transfer snapshot data to target OM
4. **Validation**: Verify snapshot integrity and consistency
5. **Application**: Apply snapshot to initialize OM state
6. **Synchronization**: Sync with current cluster state if needed

### Error Handling

- Retry mechanisms for failed transfers
- Fallback to alternative snapshot sources
- Rollback procedures for failed bootstrap attempts
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Configuration

### Required Parameters

- `ozone.om.bootstrap.enabled`: Enable/disable bootstrap functionality
- `ozone.om.snapshot.retention.count`: Number of snapshots to retain
- `ozone.om.bootstrap.timeout`: Maximum time for bootstrap operations
- `ozone.om.snapshot.transfer.chunk.size`: Transfer chunk size for optimization

### Optional Parameters

- `ozone.om.bootstrap.retry.count`: Number of retry attempts
- `ozone.om.snapshot.compression.enabled`: Enable snapshot compression
- `ozone.om.bootstrap.validation.strict`: Enable strict validation mode

## Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization for snapshot access
- Encryption of snapshot data during transfer
- Access control for bootstrap operations
- Audit logging for all bootstrap activities

## Performance Considerations

- Snapshot compression to reduce transfer time
- Parallel transfer mechanisms for large snapshots
- Bandwidth throttling to avoid network congestion
- Resource allocation for bootstrap operations

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics

- Bootstrap success/failure rates
- Snapshot creation and transfer times
- Data validation metrics
- Resource utilization during bootstrap

### Logging

- Detailed logs for each bootstrap phase
- Error tracking and analysis
- Performance monitoring data
- Security audit trails

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Snapshot creation and validation logic
- Error handling mechanisms
- Configuration validation

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end bootstrap scenarios
- Network failure simulations
- Concurrent bootstrap operations

### Performance Tests

- Large snapshot transfer performance
- Bootstrap under load conditions
- Resource utilization optimization

## Deployment Guidelines

### Prerequisites

- Configured Ozone cluster with multiple OM instances
- Network connectivity between OM nodes
- Sufficient storage for snapshot retention
- Appropriate security configurations

### Best Practices

- Regular snapshot cleanup procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Performance tuning guidelines

## Future Enhancements

- Incremental snapshot support
- Cross-datacenter bootstrap capabilities
