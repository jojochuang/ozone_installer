# Feature Documentation

This directory contains user-facing feature documentation for Ozone installer components.

## Moved Documents

### OM Bootstrapping with Snapshots

**Note**: The OM Bootstrapping with Snapshots documentation has been moved from the features section to the design section as it contains implementation details rather than user-facing features.

**New Location**: [Design Documents - OM Bootstrapping with Snapshots](../design/om-bootstrapping-with-snapshots.md)

This change was made as part of HDDS-13662 to better organize documentation by categorizing design specifications separately from user features.

## Current Features

- [Rocky9 Docker Environment Setup](../../README.md) - User guide for setting up development environments
